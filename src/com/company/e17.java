//A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
//
//Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
//
//You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
//
//You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
//
// 
//
//Example 1:
//
//Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
//Output: 2
//Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
//
//Example 2:
//
//Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
//Output: 5
//Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.

        // start and end are always trying to find max element in the above 2 checks
        // hence, when they are pointing to just one element, that is the max one because that is what the checks say
        // more elaboration: at every point of time for start and end, they have the best possible answer till that time
        // and if we are saying that only one item is remaining, hence cuz of above line that is the best possible ans
        return start; // or return end as both are =
