//An array arr a mountain if the following properties hold:
//
//    arr.length >= 3
//    There exists some i with 0 < i < arr.length - 1 such that:
//        arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]
//        arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]
//
//Given a mountain array arr, return the index i such that arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1].
//
//You must solve it in O(log(arr.length)) time complexity.
//

//
//Example 1:
//
//Input: arr = [0,1,0]
//Output: 1
//
//Example 2:
//
//Input: arr = [0,2,1,0]
//Output: 1

        // hence, when they are pointing to just one element, that is the max one because that is what the checks say
        // more elaboration: at every point of time for start and end, they have the best possible answer till that time
        // and if we are saying that only one item is remaining, hence cuz of above line that is the best possible ans
